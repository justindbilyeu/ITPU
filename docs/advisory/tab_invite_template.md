**Subject:** Advisory Review: ITPU (info-theory accelerator) — 60-min diligence

Hi **[NAME]**,

We're building the GPU for information theory - ITPU accelerates the entropy/MI primitives that current hardware handles poorly. Think real-time brain decoding instead of waiting hours for analysis.

We're convening a 3-person Technical Advisory Board for focused diligence review.

## What we need from you (once):
- Candid read on feasibility & risks  
- Sanity check on our FPGA→ASIC path
- Guidance on minimal kernel set and memory hierarchy

## Commitment:
- **Pre-read:** README + kernel spec + benchmark results (5 min)
- **Meeting:** One 60-min video call
- **Honorarium:** [optional or "happy to donate to your lab fund"]

## Agenda (60 min):
1. **10'** Problem & beachhead (BCI real-time MI)
2. **15'** Kernels, dataflow, SRAM tiling, DMA sketch  
3. **15'** Benchmarks vs software baselines
4. **10'** FPGA sizing & risks (bandwidth, precision, power)
5. **10'** Go/No-go criteria for pathfinder

If you're open, I'll send materials and a calendar hold.

Thanks!
— Justin
