# Co-Founder: Head of Silicon (FPGAâ†’ASIC)

**Mission:** Own the ITPU pathfinder architecture and lead the migration to first silicon.

## What you'll do
- Architect and prototype HIST/MI and KSG/k-NN dataflow (Verilog/VHDL/HLS)
- Design on-chip memory (SRAM/BRAM/HBM interplay), DMA, and PCIe/M.2 interface
- Define precision strategy (fixed-/mixed-point; log/exp units; Kahan accumulation)
- Build performance/power models; own bring-up and perf counters
- Collaborate with SDK team on stable ABI; drive board & lab integration

## What you've done
- Taped-out at least one ASIC or shipped high-end FPGA designs in production
- Deep experience in memory hierarchy + high-throughput streaming architectures
- Comfort with Python/C++ interop, PCIe, and benchmarking
- **Bonus:** info-theory pipelines, k-NN accelerators, medical/BCI or imaging

## Comp/fit
- Early co-founder equity + stipend/contingent salary
- Remote-friendly; hands-on, build-now mindset
- Based in [location preference] or willing to travel for hardware bring-up
